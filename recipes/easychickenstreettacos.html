<h2>Description</h2>

    <li>1 pound of seasoned, boneless, skinless chicken</li>
    <li>1 onion, diced</li>

    <li>Grill chicken, turning occasinally, until juices run clear and chicken is no longer pink at the center, about 7 minutes. An instant-read thermometer, inserted near the center, should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C)</li>
